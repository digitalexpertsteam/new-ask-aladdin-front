                        Egypt has always been a favorite destination for tourists from all over the world. Egypt is,
                        and always will be, a safe country to visit. Tourists from all over the world will always
                        feel safe in Egypt more than any other country in Europe, or in America. Egyptian people
                        have always been known for their wonderful hospitality and generosity with tourists.
                        "We are always friendly toward foreigners and they are very important to us. We would defend
                        them with our own lives. They are our guests, and we always consider our guests as family
                        members".
                        This is a quote from a taxi driver recently from an interview on Egyptian Television.</p>
